The Odin Project - Admin Dashboard

The Odin Admin Dashboard is a CSS Grid-based layout project designed to showcase a modern dashboard interface with a sidebar, header, and projects panel. Each grid area is further subdivided into nested grids to handle various functionalities, providing a flexible and responsive design.

# Project Overview

- **Sidebar:** Contains navigation links for quick access to different sections of the dashboard.
- **Header:** Displays account information, basic file controls (upload, share, new file), and a search bar.
- **Projects Panel:** Utilizes a card-based system that wraps and resizes using CSS Grid's `auto-fit` or `auto-fill` properties, ensuring an optimal layout based on the viewport size.

# Key Features

- **Responsive Layout:** Uses CSS Grid to create a flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Nested Grids:** Each main section (sidebar, header, projects panel) contains nested grids for organizing content and functionality.
- **Card-Based Display:** The projects panel dynamically adjusts the display of project cards with a grid system that automatically fits or fills based on available space.
- **Navigation & Controls:** Includes a sidebar for navigation and a header for user account controls and file management actions.
